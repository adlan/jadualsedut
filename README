JadualSedut
===========

This a simple script for those who're too lazy to click through ICRESS
just to get class timetables. Use this at your own risk and please compare
with your friend's timetable. I've used this during my studies without any
problem though.

Note:
Please inform me if faculty/campus code is changed because i'm no longer
a student there or better, you can fork this project, make changes yourself
and send me a pull request.
